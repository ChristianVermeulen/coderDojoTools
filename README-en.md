## What is CDT?
CoderDojoTools (CDT) is a set of checklists and the "Gordon Model" set of rules to help a champion create and run a Coder Dojo

## Who Is CDT For?
The CDT is meant for the champion, of a Coder Dojo about to launch or already established. The CDT is meant to be the foundation of the dojo's standard operating procedures.


## What's In It?

CDT contains checklists to make sure that all fundamental tasks have been assigned and performed, either for the starting event or for all subsequent events.

## How Do I Use It?

1. **Create** your CoderDojo by following the steps in [Start A Dojo](https://coderdojo.com/start/)
2. **Organize** and run your events from the first one on with the CDT checklists: the checklists remind you of all the tasks that are necessary to guarantee an event's success, so you don't have to sweat the small things (not to mention waste your time).
The checklists will save you time, so you can concentrate on what's important.


## Where Does It Come From?

I like to know what needs to be done, and I hate when I overlook some detail or when I have to waste too much energy making sure everything is in order.

When I set about launching a CoderDojo, I immediately searched for checklists or standard operating procedures, but found none. So I made my own. These are the checklists I have developed over the launch of two CoderDojos, Rimini and Pesaro, in January 2015.

## Who's Gordon, anyway?

 Gordon Way, founder of WayForward Technologies, in Douglas Adams's [The Long, Dark Teatime Of The Soul](http://www.amazon.com/Long-Dark-Tea-Time-Soul/dp/0671742515/). It's a long story.
Gordon Way is also my programming alter ego.

## How do I get it?

The official coderDojoTools repo is at [github.com/gordonway/coderDojoTools](http://github.com/gordonway/coderDojoTools)

## Caveat

Checklists do not substitute a champion's work, but they are useful to keep track of what needs to be done, and to distribue tasks across the team.
