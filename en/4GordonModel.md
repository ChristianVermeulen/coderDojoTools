# The Gordon Model, Or The Rules of the Dojo

## We work together
We kids work in couples or triples (tuples); **what we learn is  egoless programming.** <br />
*Author note: the reason for this is complex, and has to do with my concept of post-autistic IT. In a nutshell, there's no point in learning alone only to find out, years down the road, that pair programming works better*.

## We work across age
The elder ones among us pair with the younger ones; we relate and work better together than if we are divided by age. The elders will demonstrate **responsibility and leadership**, and the younger ones will give their best in **attention and effort** to keep up with the elders. In this way, quiet is a normal condition, quite unlike what happens in our classroom.

## We work across gender
We work together,boys and girls; **programming is a brain's thing, not a boy's thing**. We learn that a group works better without unnecessary competitiveness. We also learn that **there is always more than one way** to look at a problem, and more than one way to solve it. When possible, girls form the majority in a tuple.

## We take turns at the keyboard
We learn that being at the keyboard does not mean meaning at the helm. We also learn that **thinking is just as important as typing**. By taking turns, the smartest or the quickest among us are motivated to behave as mentors to the others.

## Mentors are there for us, but only when needed
Mentors will only come when we call; the dojo is for us to put all of our energy into learning: **we are the ones there to invent, create and test our limits**. Besides, if mentors are silent, we speak to one another within or across tuples, and learn to ask questions and to understand answers.

##We learn playfully, and our learning is recognised
At every event, we kids will get a certificate recognising our participation and accomplishments. This is because in a dojo **we learn stuff, we learn to learn and we learn to collaborate**, and these are  important things that must be recognised. We will also get gadgets as a little prize for our effort.

*Author's note: there may also be a "star giver" roaming the tables, a mentor with a sheet of adhesive stars that will be awarded every time a tuple completes a given step.*
